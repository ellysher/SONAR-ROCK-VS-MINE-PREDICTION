# Rock vs. Mine Prediction using SONAR Data with Logistic Regression

![SONAR](sonar_image.jpg)

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether an object in an underwater environment is a rock or a mine using SONAR data. SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology is widely used for acoustic detection and classification of objects underwater. For this project, we implemented a Logistic Regression model in Python to perform binary classification between rocks and mines based on the SONAR readings.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection:** We sourced a reliable dataset containing SONAR readings of rocks and mines.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The data was cleaned, missing values handled, and normalization applied.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features were extracted from the SONAR data.
4. **Model Building:** We implemented the Logistic Regression algorithm using scikit-learn.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** The model was trained and evaluated on various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Results:** The Logistic Regression model demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing rocks from mines based on SONAR data.
7. **Deployment:** The trained model is deployed in a user-friendly Python application for real-time predictions.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we successfully developed a robust Logistic Regression model capable of accurately predicting rock or mine objects in an underwater environment using SONAR data. This project demonstrates our proficiency in machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. The code and application provided in this repository serve as valuable resources for understanding and implementing similar classification tasks.
